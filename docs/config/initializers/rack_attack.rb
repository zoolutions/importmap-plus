# Throttle the public, unauthenticated AI/tooling endpoints docs-kit exposes:
#   POST /mcp            — the Model Context Protocol server (JSON-RPC)
#   GET  /llms.txt       — the llmstxt.org index
#   GET  /llms-full.txt  — every page concatenated
#   GET  /docs/search    — the search index (html + json)
#
# These are read-only over already-public content, but they're outward-facing and
# cheap to hammer (llms-full.txt concatenates every page; search scans the index),
# so a per-IP cap keeps a scraper or a runaway agent from dominating a single
# server. The docs-kit controllers are bare ActionController::Base subclasses, so
# a controller-level `rate_limit` can't reach them — a Rack middleware can.
#
# Rack::Attack counts in its own cache. Rails.cache is a MemoryStore in dev and a
# per-server FileStore in production (both fine for a per-server throttle); it's a
# NullStore in test, so give Rack::Attack an explicit MemoryStore there so the
# throttle is exercisable in specs and never silently a no-op.

  if Rails.env.test?

# 60 requests/minute per IP across the AI endpoints — generous for a human or a
